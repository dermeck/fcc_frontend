                <h5>Fictional biography</h5>
                <p>
                    Geralt is the son of the sorceress Visenna and, presumably, the warrior Korin. Shortly after his
                    birth,
                    Geralt
                    was taken by his mother to the School of the Wolf at the stronghold of Kaer Morhen. There, Geralt
                    was
                    trained
                    and made to be a witcher. He survived the many blistering mutations required to grant witchers their
                    abilities, and passed the Trial of the Grasses. Geralt's training and physical modifications
                    provided him
                    with
                    superhuman physical and mental abilities, including heightened reflexes, increased speed, great
                    strength,
                    and
                    enhanced hearing.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Due to his brilliant success in training, Geralt was selected for additional mutation experiments.
                    He is the
                    only witcher to have survived these experiments, his stark white hair being a side effect of these
                    additional
                    mutations. After finishing his witcher training, Geralt embarked into the world on a horse named
                    Roach, a
                    name
                    he would bestow upon every one of his later horses. Thus, he became a monster slayer for hire.

                <p>
                    At one point, Geralt demanded the unborn child of princess Pavetta and her husband Duny (an alias of
                    Emhyr
                    var
                    Emreis, the Emperor of Nilfgaard) as a reward for his services. The child was born a girl, and
                    Geralt
                    refused
                    her. However, fate caused Geralt and the girl, Cirilla, to cross paths three times. Eventually,
                    Geralt took
                    the girl as his protégé, following the death of her grandmother, Queen Calanthe. Now, he loves her
                    as his
                    own
                    daughter.
